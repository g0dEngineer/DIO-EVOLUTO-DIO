# Mid-term to Long-term Goals 

⚫ Under my omni-automobil category (not only car with shapes, but shapes constructed around sustainable energy visual design)

⚫ Glass like bonnet divider etc could act as a type of solar absorption unit

⚫ Rear "aileron diffusers" could act as bladeless turbines that vibrate appropriately to generate usable energy.

⚫ On board (low energy consumption) 3d artificial intelligence/human assistant/friend in automobile, similar to [my xSynth Honda Civic Demo](https://youtu.be/pxgLJSd3_-s).
