# Mid-term to Long-term Goals 

The construction of this prototype harkens back to [the long discontinued time when Jamaica](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2003/08/30/jamaica-enters-auto-business-with-1st-island-cruiser-jeep-2/), via Excel Motors, produced its own Jamaican made Jeep over 20 years ago.

In addition, this protypype shall, beyond the iconic Jamaican made Jeeps of the past era:

A. Serve schools/universities as practical mode of Ai application/usage in helping to further propel Jamaica into the modern era of Ai.
B. Focus on sustainable energy usage.



# Real life, full scale 1 of 1 production of my 3d concept Dio has began. This shall be a repository concerning software development re Dio.

✋✋Looking for some volunteers to help me along in this little project!
#OmniAutomobil #Dio #NewSustainableEnergyVisualCarDesignCategory


# Features

⚫ Glass like bonnet divider etc could act as a type of solar absorption unit

⚫ Rear "aileron diffusers" could act as bladeless turbines that vibrate appropriately to generate usable energy.

⚫ Under [my omni-automobil category](https://www.behance.net/gallery/125520935/TheOmniAutomobil-Sustainable-Energy-Visual-Car-Design) (not only car with shapes, but shapes constructed around sustainable energy visual design)

⚫ On board (low energy consumption) 3d artificial intelligence/human assistant/friend in automobile, similar to [my xSynth Honda Civic Demo](https://youtu.be/pxgLJSd3_-s).
